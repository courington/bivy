			<h1>Bivy is an open source CSS framework built on SASS (but is easily portable to LESS)</h1>
			<p>The intuitive syntax inspired by other larger frameworks helps the developer build out a prototype or production app/site quickly with a light footprint. Using % and Ems, Bivy stays flexible to be easily purpose built for smaller screens or designed for responsiveness across multiple devices.</p>
			<p>Bivy is a baseline framework that you can use and/or fork to get started building on top of.</p>
